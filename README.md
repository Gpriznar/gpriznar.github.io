# My first website!

**Purpose:**

Humble beginnings...

This website was created with self taught HTML/CSS/Javascript as a way to test my intial knowledge!

**How to use:**

When visiting the website for the first time, the user will be prompted to enter a name. This name will then be incorperated into a "welcome" greeting once you land on the main page. The website mostly displays static information, however, there are four interactive elements. If you click my profile picture it will render an alternate image of myself wearing sunglasses! If you click the music button (only once...be patient!) it will play "Guile's Theme" from SNES's Street Fighter. If you want to change the name displayed in the "welcome" message you can select the "change user" button in the bottom left hand corner. Lastly you should be able to follow visit my LinkedIn profile by clicking on the associated link. 


**Features:** 

Javascript, HTML, CSS
